## Reflection
### What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
- I think if there were more days to study express. Not enough time to truly grasp everything. This has to be the toughest concept. In time I will get there. By the time this is graded I hope to finish.

### Were there any requirements that were dificult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
- The HTTP requests in relation to the form are pretty tricky. Using postman is sort of like a science and is tricky as well.
### What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
- The design!! I feel like there was not enough time given to finish this assignment. Still tweaking the functionality but no time for design aspect.
